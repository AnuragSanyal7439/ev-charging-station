Electrical Vehicle charging station and Slot Booking 
Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable mode of transportation. 
However, one of the main challenges faced by EV owners is the availability and accessibility of 
charging stations. In this research, we present the development and implementation of an EV charging 
station finding the app using the Flutter framework. The app utilizes the Google Maps API to display 
the location of nearby charging stations and provides detailed information such as the type of connector,
availability, and pricing. The app also allows users to filter charging stations based on their preferences 
and report any inaccuracies or out-of-service stations. User testing was conducted to evaluate the 
usability and effectiveness of the app. Results showed that the app was easy to use and provided accurate 
and up-to-date information on charging stations. The implementation of the app can help address the 
issue of charging station availability and improve the overall EV ownership experience
